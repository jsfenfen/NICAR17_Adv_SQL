# NICAR17_Adv_SQL
[NICAR 2017 conference](https://ire.org/conferences/nicar2017/) tutorial that walks through truthing data, joins, updates and other concepts.

This class is based on similar classes taught by Liz Lucas at NICAR15 and Kendall Taggart at NICAR16. We're going to be using SQLite Studio, although you could also use a free Firefox plugin that makes it easier to use SQLite on your computer. You can download it [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/).

All the SQL for the class is in this file: SQL_queries.md

We're going to use inspection data from the Department of Labor/Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 

Here's the description of OSHA data from [DOL's website](http://ogesdw.dol.gov/views/data_summary.php): "The dataset consists of inspection case detail for approximately 100,000 OSHA inspections conducted annually. The dataset includes information regarding the impetus for conducting the inspection, and details on citations and penalty assessments resulting from violations of OSHA standards. Additionally, accident investigation information is provided, including textual descriptions of the accident, and details regarding the injuries and fatalities which occurred."

Inspection, accident and injury datasets were downloaded from the [DOL's site](http://ogesdw.dol.gov/views/data_summary.php) in February 2016. 

Note: The files that are currently up on that site are incomplete and erroneous, and should not be used for analysis until they've been corrected by OSHA and thoroughly vetted for completeness. OSHA also has a seemingly modern API, but as of late February 2017 the servers were down and no data could be accessed. Department of Labor data admins on March 3 acknowledged that these data problems were "a glitch" that needs fixing.
